## Project Description

MediTrack is a simple and user-friendly medicine scheduling web application that helps users manage their daily and weekly medications. Users can add medicines, set the time and frequency, and mark them as taken. The application stores all data locally in the browser using LocalStorage, making it lightweight and easy to use without a backend server.

---

## The Problem Statement

Many people forget to take their medicines on time, especially elderly individuals and patients who have multiple prescriptions. Managing medication schedules manually can lead to missed doses, which may negatively affect health. There is a need for a simple digital solution that helps users track medicines easily and reliably.

---

## The Solution

MediTrack provides an easy-to-use web interface where users can:

- Log in with their name
- Add medicines with a specific time
- Choose daily or weekly scheduling
- Select specific days for weekly medicines
- View only today’s scheduled medicines
- Mark medicines as taken

The app uses browser LocalStorage to store data securely on the user’s device without requiring internet or backend support.
